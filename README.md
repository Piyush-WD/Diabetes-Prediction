# Diabetes-Prediction

The Diabetes Prediction Website is an advanced web-based platform designed to 
assess an individual's risk of developing diabetes. Built using Python, the project 
integrates various technologies, including Flask for web development, Pandas 
and NumPy for data processing and analysis, and machine learning models 
serialized with Pickle for efficient deployment. Development and testing were 
conducted in Google Collaboratory and PyCharm, ensuring a streamlined 
workflow for building and refining the prediction system. The platform utilizes 
user-provided health data, such as age, BMI, blood glucose levels, physical 
activity, and family medical history, to deliver accurate, personalized risk 
assessments. With a user-friendly interface and strict data privacy protocols, the 
website also provides actionable lifestyle recommendations and educational 
resources to encourage early intervention and preventive care. By merging 
advanced technologies with healthcare, this platform aims to raise awareness, 
promote healthy living, and support a proactive approach to diabetes 
management.
